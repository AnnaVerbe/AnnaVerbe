I am Anna Verbe, ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on developing 2-photon imaging with in vivo optogenetic stimulation of the larval brain of Drosophila melanogaster. I previously worked on how locomotor output is structured by precise sensory input and on the Aerial righting reflex of hoverflies. My work includes mechanosensors, neuroethology, locomotion and neurosciences.
